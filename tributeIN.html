      <h2>Early Life and Academic Pursuits</h2>
      <p>Born on January 4, 1643, in Woolsthorpe, Lincolnshire, England, Isaac Newton displayed an insatiable curiosity and intellect from a young age. Despite facing numerous challenges, including the loss of his father before his birth, Newton pursued his passion for learning with unwavering determination. He attended Trinity College, Cambridge, where he embarked on his illustrious academic career.</p>
      <p>Newton had been developing his theory of gravitation as far back as 1665. In 1679, Newton returned to his work on celestial mechanics by considering gravitation and its effect on the orbits of planets with reference to Kepler's laws of planetary motion. This followed stimulation by a brief exchange of letters in 1679–80 with Hooke, who had been appointed Secretary of the Royal Society, and who opened a correspondence intended to elicit contributions from Newton to Royal Society transactions. Newton's reawakening interest in astronomical matters received further stimulus by the appearance of a comet in the winter of 1680–1681, on which he corresponded with John Flamsteed. After the exchanges with Hooke, Newton worked out a proof that the elliptical form of planetary orbits would result from a centripetal force inversely proportional to the square of the radius vector. Newton communicated his results to Edmond Halley and to the Royal Society in De motu corporum in gyrum, a tract written on about nine sheets which was copied into the Royal Society's Register Book in December 1684.[75] This tract contained the nucleus that Newton developed and expanded to form the Principia.</p>
